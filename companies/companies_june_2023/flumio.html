                <br><u>Future Plans</u>
                Online first, physical store later: during the first three years, manufacturing will be limited to a non-assembly based production model to reduce fabrication costs; then move to modular robotic cells<br>
                Gap in the market for customizable and affordable furniture - technological advances suggest that production will decrease and that customization will become more accessible<br>

            <h3>Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Team should:</u><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the group of users and the domain</li>
                    <li>Have a product that either addresses [a] a new need or [b] a new way to satisfy an existing need</li>
                    <li>Have users who want to use their product</li>
                    <li>Have a product that leads into a big market (founders are living in the future)</li>
                    <li>Are able to build a product, deliver it, and iterate on it; some competitive advantage/competitive moat</li>
                </ol>

                The team seems to have <b>[1]</b> a minimal understanding of the group users and of the furniture domain, but their expertise in robotic and design is highly advanced (Doctorate at Carnegie Mellon for both co-founders), <b>[3]</b> lack market and customer discovery (no customer discovery, broad target audience group of 25-65 years old), <b>[5]</b> don't have a clear growth strategy and go to market plan, nor do the founders have tech or sales experience, making it unclear that they will be able to build, deliver, and iterate on the product.<br>

                <br>However, Flumio does seem to have <b>[2]</b> have a new way of satisfying an existing need (generative customization and robotic production of furniture), <b>[4]</b> have a product that could lead into a big market (~$7b in US custom furniture annually).<br>

                <br>It appears that the difficult part of building this solution will be <b>[a]</b> the automated production and assembly of the custom pieces, and <b>[b]</b> Automatic Engineering & Fabrication Code and Image to Parametric 3D model. While <b>[a]</b> seems like a question of capital, which can be solved, it is unclear whether the two have the technical ability to assess and build on the larger question of <b>[b]</b>, which if solved, would dramatically improve the business' health. Prehaps the questions to be asked about this company is whether it is a "wrapper" or if they are using their own models, what advantage/disadvantage that causes, if the product itself is really still interesting without the generative AI component, if there is a significant moat that exists or that can be created (would probably occur on the production side), and are the founders capable of creating that moat and possess a competitive advantage to do so.<br>

                <br>Thus, based on this analysis, while the founders may have the technical skills to begin the businesses, it isn't clear whether they have the experience to iterate on their product, growth that product, and more worryingly, it doesn't appear that they have a solid understanding of their market and customer. Perhaps an interview would revel differently, but there is currently a gap in the Customer profile.
