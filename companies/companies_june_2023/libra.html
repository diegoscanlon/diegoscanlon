                <br><b>Overview:</b> Data contracts management platform to create more reliable exchanges of data (API like agreement between two parties on how data is to be exchanged that allows engineering teams/downstream users to enforce contracts expectations/assertions about the data) <br>
                <br><b>Problem:</b> There currently exists a lack of coordination between data producers and consumers where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integrations are lengthy; frequent changing of data models (products and infrastructure mature)</li>
                        <li>Producers have limited visibility of who is using their data and how</li>
                        <li>Producers haev limited accountability for changes in suplied data that creates "breaking changes" and "data fires"</li>
                    </ul>

            Chris has an extensive background in Data & Analytics and the startup ecosystem; team's experience would suggest that they understand their customer, their market and a network to build a team and push product. <b>More descriptive conclusion about founder and team abilities in Thoughts and Conclusion section of this page.</b>

            <h3>Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Team should:</u><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the group of users and the domain</li>
                    <li>Have a product that either addresses [a] a new need or [b] a new way to satisfy an existing need</li>
                    <li>Have users who want to use their product</li>
                    <li>Have a product that leads into a big market (founders are living in the future)</li>
                    <li>Are able to build a product, deliver it, and iterate on it; some competitive advantage/competitive moat</li>
                </ol>

                I personally don't have a background in Data and its infrastructure to judge the forward-facing merit of the problem
                 or the product. However, the founder's background seems to position him well to <b>[1]</b> understand the
                 users of data contracts and the domain of big data (ex Director at Data companies), <b>[2]</b> recognize 
                 the absence for a specific new need of stronger guidelines in data contracts and the relationship between 
                 data producers and consumers, <b>[3]</b> has already begun speaking to users who want to user their 
                 product (initial discovery of 40 users, in conversation with 5 design partners for MVP), and <b>[4]</b> 
                 has a product that leads to a big market (total addressable market ~$5b), also convinced that founder knows the market they are in (PG)

                <br><br>What I cannot analyze right now is <b>[5]</b> the team's ability to build, deliver, and iterate the product.
                 It is unclear who is coding the product, whether the founder has the technical skills or whether he is 
                 outsourcing to a part-time teammate or hiring someone who is not yet there. Thus, the final component which 
                 <b>I'd hope to get from interviews</b> would be a better analysis of the [a] technical abilities of the team, 
                 [b] relationship between the founding team, and [c] areas of the team of which they are lacking, and how 
                 they intend on fixing those areas.
