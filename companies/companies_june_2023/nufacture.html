        <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Curious to understand the validity of the painpoint nufacture is solving - is searching for these components truly difficult/scattered? What are the current search mechanisms in place? If the problem is valid, and existing infastructure for this search doesn't exist, then I think the problem would be widespread and thus exploitable for a growing business</li>
            <li>Interested in the audience he is targeting, benefits of certain business models (B2B, D2C, enterprise subscription)</li>
            <li>Curious to see if there already exists some type of search mechanism in any other software that the industrial-sector uses that either contains a similar search-for-parts mechanism or <em>could include this mechanism</em></li>
            <li>Freeman has extensive experience within the industrial sector (both installation and management), sets him up well to understand the needs of the industry and possibly the network to connect with potential customers; well positioned to be the person who solves it</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id = "verticles, customers, business model">
        <h3>Verticles and Customers</h3>
        <p>Existing business model is unclear from website but thoughts on business model below...<br>
        I think there are two sides of the platform that Nufacture could extract revenue from:
        <ul>
            <li>Revenue from buyer: whether this is a subscription to use the service or a fee charged on a per purchase basis</li>
            <li>Revenue from seller: the site has a distribution network to showcase parts, prices, and avaliability from select retailers - why not charge a service fee to host your catologue online or have an affiliate percentage from purchases that go through the site?</li>
        </ul>
        Creating this two sided marketplace allows you to extract revenue from two parties.

        <h3>Founder and Team</h3>
        <p><b><u>Freeman Smith</u></b>, Founder<br>
            Masters at Harvard, Computre Software Engineering<br>
            Bachelors at Purdue, Mechanical ENgineering<br>
            Extensive experience in industrial spaces and computer science
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science Manager, Pratt & Whitney (Aviation and Aerospace component manufacturing)</li>
                <li>Technical Support Specialist, CKD USA (Automation Technology)</li>
                <li>Field Engineer, Product Engineer prior </li>

    <div id="product features">
        <h3>Product Features</h3>
        <p>end users transparent pricing and avaliability on indusrtial compoenents, we are making manufacturing more efficient, giving distributors equal opportunity, and minimizing customer downtime<br>
            21 million parts in catalog; 15k manufactures, 48 distributors

        </p>
        </div>
    
    <div id="Thoughts and Conclusion">
        <ul>
            <li>Would probably benefit from customers who are constantly sourcing their own parts frequently and don't have a seller that their organization has to go through (thinking about individual repair shop versus a Toyota repair shop)</li>
            <li>However, could also work for individuals/hobbyists who are looking for specific parts too; <b>Interested in the audience he is targeting, benefits of certain business models (B2B, D2C, enterprise subscription)</b></li>
            <li>One concern to this SMB and hobbyist is the friction related to recruiting and onboarding users - seems difficult to recruit en masse and thus contract size would be hard</li>
            <li>Any space to sell to larger enterprises (PG&E)? What system do they use to purchase parts?</li>
            <li>Curious to see if there already exists some type of search mechanism in any other software that the industrial-sector uses that either contains a similar search-for-parts mechanism or could include this mechanism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solo founder, may make simultaneous product development and sales challenging in regards to time</p>
