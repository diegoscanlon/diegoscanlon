        <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Netflix crackdown on password sharing to increase individual subscriptions seems like a solid proof of concept that decreasing account sharing is a valid approach to increasing revenue
                </li>
            <li>Problem seems widespread in many domains that use family subscription models for discounted rates that users take advantage of
                </li>
            <li>Mechanism to implement Rupt seems straightforward as you're plugging into your own system, founder is experienced technical lead and a repeat founder
                </li>
            <li>Could benefit from an incubator through network growth, especially in the United States, and showcase the technology to more companies with these subscription models to grow untapped revenue
                </li>

        <h3>Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <a href= "https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/netflix-begins-its-password-sharing-crackdown-in-the-u-s/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJRnHi9_EujOsK5QhjEPCSCCFTtCApUJZKfbTgQS72gukyTVSBIF7te-67Ku4PHuXHOw2eTeS-gyeFUdMIpwBLRwPuSPaUoJDPWnLEQVmz4gpoH5uMVO0Bayn1jAlgG-wkFUSKGy9_SGlRbaIiGutSUpH6GgEWFuU2YiUL_DO0Ma">
                Netflix recently cracked down on password sharing
                </a>
            <ul>
                <li>Either kick people off their Netflix account or pay subscription for an additional membership for those outside their main household
                    </li>
                <li>Process included "a way for current subscribers to view which devices are signed into their account and remove those that shouldn't have access"
                    </li>
                <li>Transfer Profile: helps relocated users transfer existing account information, including viewing history and watchlist
                    </li>
            </ul>
            Would be curious to see if Netflix crackdown technology was created internally or externally, <u>would give some insight into the cost associated with a company building this out on their own</u>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly other subscription video entertainment companies like Netflix (HBO Max, Paramount, Disney) that could probably benefit from the reactionary research that Netflix has done
                    </li>
                <li>Other subscription based companies (Spotify) that offer family plans (under one roof) are being exploited and could probably use this tracking of multiple accounts. 
                    </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Mechanism for the technology is simple: plug in Rupt SDKs into your project, takes less than 1 day<br>
            Founder should be focused on getting larger companies to test the product - <u>hurdle may be convincing companies that users will actually sign up instead of just abandoning the subscription all together</u>; seems to be dependent on conversion when nudged<br>
            How customizable is the interface in a customer's application?
