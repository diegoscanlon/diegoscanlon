            <h3>Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    <u>Team should:</u><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Understand the group of users and the domain</li>
                        <li>Have a product that either addresses [a] a new need or [b] a new way to satisfy an existing need</li>
                        <li>Have users who want to use their product</li>
                        <li>Have a product that leads into a big market (founders are living in the future)</li>
                        <li>Are able to build a product, deliver it, and iterate on it; some competitive advantage/competitive moat</li>
                    </ol>
                <b>[1]</b> Team doesn't appear to have a connection with industrial or environmental sector and just a basic 
                understanding of monitoring/detection in those fields (backgrounds aren't in those sectors), <b>[3]</b> haven't 
                done customer discovery, and thus unclear whether there are users who want to user their product, and 
                <b>[5]</b> while the founding team seem to have strong chemistry 
                (father-son), and potentially the technical ability to execute (SWE @ Google and Amazon, Physics masters 
                and extensive experience, ML since 2019), I would want to learn more about the technology that they are 
                using (Wrapper company or building their own LLMs), growth strategy (current practices, satellite imagery), 
                and customer discovery they have already done. Additionally, it is unclear what combination the team would be doing:
                [a] creating the synthetic data to train the models (images) and selling that data, [b] creating the models themselves  using their created data and licensing those models,
                [c] using their owned trained models and created data to do the actual monitoring for customers. Thus, how 
                Sidereus actually integrates with their customers is vague, probably in part becuase of the lack of customer discovery and understanding on
                the specific issues the company would be addressing.<br> 

                <br>The <b>[4]</b> market for creating synthetic data is a large market, especially in the field where the overall 
                lack of available data for a specific industry (environment and industry) can be widely applied outside 
                of the intended customers of Sidereus, <b>[2]</b> has a new way addressing an existing need (lack of real 
                world data to train models for specific use cases), but it a bit unclear whether there are paying customers for the application of those models.<br>
                
                

                <br>Thus, while the technology and overall idea of synthetic data training has merit, and focus on a specific 
                sector is interesting (although may limit initial market, or not, could start there and iterate), the founders' 
                experience in ML, potential lack of ability to pivot, and lack of understanding of the current market, customer 
                discovery, and growth strategy are points to address.
