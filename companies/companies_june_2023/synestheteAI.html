            <h3>Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Team should:</u><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the group of users and the domain</li>
                    <li>Have a product that either addresses [a] a new need or [b] a new way to satisfy an existing need</li>
                    <li>Have users who want to use their product</li>
                    <li>Have a product that leads into a big market (founders are living in the future)</li>
                    <li>Are able to build a product, deliver it, and iterate on it; some competitive advantage/competitive moat</li>
                </ol>

                Product <b>[2]</b> has a new way to satisfy an existing need (low cost high quality audio-video generation to increase streams and engagement for artists, current video production is expensive), team has <b>[3]</b> conducted customer discovery and have users who want their product (100 user interviews, 95 in beta), and <b>[4]</b> has a product that leads into a bigger market (music industry, 60M musicians on various platforms, giving them a decent understanding of user groups and domain). <br>

                <br>However, doubts about the relationship of the founding team, <b>[1]</b> their connection, network, and understanding with users of the music industry, and technical abilities make their ability to <b>[5]</b> build, deliver, and iterate on the product unclear. There is no GTM strategy outlined, and the same can be said for the product cycle (what about creation specific to lyrics of the video, so the video changes along with the lyrics). While the founder has a background at reputable companies (Meta, Goldman, Deloitte) in product and consulting, I would like to learn more about his past products and ability to build. William also seems to possess a strong background in ML (theory and application) but it is unclear whether he possesses the technical abilities to create and iterate on the product. The barriers to entry on this product seem low enough to where the founders do not possess a strong competitive advantage in their backgrounds to accelerate the product's growth. Their experience working together is also unclear, and personally the founder video made me feel uneasy about the dynamic.<br>

                <br>Overall, the product feels like a feature that one could implement in a video editing software or music creation software, or one that could easily be developed internally by an application like Spotify to put behind a player. Additionally, the technical barriers to entry on a product like this, or the current technology that they are using, seem relatively low and very "wrapper" like (not developing their own model but using another company's). Thus, the moat and obvious competitive advantage (no proprietary data and models, no exclusive contracts with large customers, no exceptional talent in the selected field). The deck does not feel developed, even with the founder's extensive experience in product (Meta, Goldman, Deloitte) and inserts some uncertainty in the ability of the non-technical founders and product developer.<br>

                <br>Thus, in the interview, I would ask more about why the team thinks they are uniquely positioned to capture this user and market (technical, product, and network), the relationship between members in the founding team, and any GTM or product strategy.
