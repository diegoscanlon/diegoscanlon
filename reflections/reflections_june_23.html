      <p>keeping track of what I do, who I meet, and how I feel in venture capital</p>

      <h4><em>June 12, 2023</em></h4>
        <article>
            <p>For the past three days, I've been reviewing a short list of Techstars applications for the September 2023 Chicago accelorator. While creating this list, I sorted the applications into three groups: there were companie that were obviously not preferred, some companies that I wanted to look into more, and companies that I was really interested in.
                Since there were over 500 companies to review, the initial analysis/dilligence that I was doing was short and limited as I was mainly going off the idea more broadly, and some indicator checks on the founders (experience, education, etc). 
                However, as this list of companies to review got shorter and I started to focus on shortening the list of companies that I liked, it became rare that my initial good impression of the company stuck after completing a more detailed analysis of the company's deck, founders, and vision. 
                There are two things I wish to address in this reflection: [1] the fear that I am being too pessimistic in my analysis, and [2] how quickly the judgement tools I used changed after being exposed to a single source that told me how to evaluate these companies.<br>

                <br>[1] I asked Brad, my lead at Techstars, the following message on Basecamp at the end of my day after reviewing my top applications: <br>
                    <br> "Made a list of top 20 companies Friday but as I'm doing deeper dives into each company, not many are surviving my initial good impressions. Wrote reports for my top 5 today, only think 1 or 2 are still decent. Is that okay or concerning? Being too pessimistic?"<br><br>
                Out of the five companies that I had done in-depth dilligence for, I only remained excited about two. And I couldn't imagine becoming more excited about the companies that I had yet to review but which I had initially ranked lower.
                I was finding lots of problems with the founding teams themselves, their product and growth strategy, and most of all when I judged their understanding of their target market/users. 
                Out of the 500+ companies that I had looked at, some had good ideas, but wrong founders. Some had wrong ideas. Very very few had good ideas and good founders. That number? <b>2</b>. And one of those two I'm a little unsure about.
                Right now I feel like it might be hard to make many investments. Maybe that's why investors make so little - becuase you're waiting for the right fit. Which makes sense now that I say it outloud.
                I was speaking with another of mentor of mine and about his experience working in early stage venture in Asia and he warned me about "adverse deal-flow," meaning the deals that you're looking at are the deals that the better companies don't want. 
                While Techstars is the opposite of a bad accelorator, I consider it on par with YC, I do wonder how the location of the accelorator (Chicago) infuences the types of deals and companies we see. 
                Changing just the location filted on Pitchbook from Chicago to San Francisco, keeping the same filters about industry, company size, etc, you get a lot more, dare I say, interesting startups related to consumer tech, AI/ML, big data. 
                So maybe this is, in some ways, a form of adverse dealflow, as the companies that aren't based in San Francisco with former Google and Stripe engineers are applying to the San Francisco location and not Chicago. 
                Maybe this lack of traditional talent that VCs are looking for in founders is the reason why I feel that I'm being very pessimistic about my selection. <br>
                <br><em>So, if there is something to take away from this first point, it's that [a] you need to be patient when looking at companies, don't invest becuase you need to fill an investment quota but make sure the product, founder, and everything else aligns with your goals and values, and,
                    [b] maybe the geography you're analyzing lacks some elements that you're looking for and that's why you're feeling this certain way. 
                    </em><br>
                
                <br>[2] Between days of analysis, I read Paul Graham's Billionaires Build article which discusses what YC partners look for in their 10 minute interview with applications. 
                The article completely changed my approach to analysis: while I used to focus on product and indicators on founders, I now focus mainly around the idea of how well does this founder know their market and their users, and how fit are they to build, ship, and iterate for users. 
                I'm afraid that the influence this one article had on me is indicative of something else: I'm naive, don't know what I should be looking for, and therefore easily change my perspective on issues. In other words, I have no opinion, and my opinion is based on the opinions of others. 
                <br>There is another example of this: the day before the Apple Vision Pro was announced, I came accross an AR company that I didn't like. The next day, I returned to that company and did dilligence on it. I'm not sure if this is an example of <em>string opinions loosely held </em> or of me not being able to see in the future,
                but it concerns me that I was only going to look at this company if there was some indication that I should/if the idea and the market was alredy proven. But that's not what I should be doing. <br>
                PG says that YC partners look for founders who are "living in the future", and thus as a capital allocator, I will have to make judgements about what "living in the future" looks like, but I clearly missed it this time.<br>
                <em>Thus, I don't know if me changing my analytical criterea based off one article by PG is a good or bad thing, nor do I understand how to evaluate if a founder is "living in the future" because I'm not sure that I am.</em>

      <h4><em>June 4, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>assessing a company: what matters more in early stage assessment, founder or idea? or both equally as much?<br>
        also, what makes a good angel investor? and is it right for me?
          <ul>
              <li> 
                did some more format written assessments today of two companies that I like, Rupt and Layer. I really like both ideas but don't know too much about the founders. I don't know how much
                Thus, I don't feel like I can make a super fair assessment of the company's health without talking to the founder and seeing how motivated they are about the idea. Further confirms my thoughts that 
                in order to begin making good decisions. What I did enjoy though was when I got to write down my ideas for the product, ways that they should approach their GTM, companies that they should talk to and 
                strategies that they should work on. That being said, it did have me think a bit more about the stage of investing I want to do, which I'll continue here...
                </li>
              <li>
                ...I really like contributing to ideas and product, and think that early stage would allow me to do that best. However, I think maybe the concept of angel lends it self too much to arbitrary assessment metrics,
                (maybe ones I haven't learned yet, sure), but at the moment, it seems a bit vague what makes a good angel investor. However, for something maybe like Seed, more like Series A, where product, GTM is the main focus,
                I think that's where I can provide a much better value add. Just want to keep track of this thought.
                </li>
          </ul>
        angel assessment of companies is a little vague for me right now, but I love contributing to ideas and product and strategy, so a stage like Series A may allow me to provide more value add to a founder and their company.

      <h4><em>June 3, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>started sourcing work using PitchBook, running in to two issues: differentiated dealflow, sector agnostic <br>
          <ul>
              <li> The first is how to source differentiated dealflow. I can't imagine all 
                  new companies are on PitchBook, or that all the good companies are on there, so I need to figure out a way to find better companies/different more diversified sources. Came across 
                  <a href="https://www.scroobious.com/" target="blank">Scroobious</a > on Twitter (don't really like the name but not my company), and signed up. They allow founders to post quick videos 
                  about their companies, which I think is a great idea. Similar to what I find so valuable in the YC video application - quick, easy, and direct, but might also be a great sourcing
                  mechanism - looking at all the YC application videos, then reaching out to those people as well. The information is compiled there for you and is quickly and easily accessible. 
                  Maybe something that I can implement into this website - just a place where anyone with an idea can post a quick Loom or something similar, create tags, specifically for early stage.
                  </li>
              <li>The second is that becuase the focus of Techstars, who I'm doing the sourcing for is sector agnostic, I can't really say if a company is good or not, if a founding team is qualified or not.
                  So, what I think I'm going to do in the future is look at specific domains that I am interested in, make calls there, and let someone else look at healthcare or robotics.
                  </li>
          </ul>
        need to find a solution to get better dealflow - whether that be finding a source that not everyone has, or using a platform in a different way that gives me an edge to find better founders and companies.
      </p>

      <h4><em>June 2, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>started doing work for Techstars incubator, sector agnostic making it difficult
          <ul>
              <li>First tasks was going through a list of 150 sourced companies and ranking my favorites. Found it a little difficult to know what I should be looking for. I've heard early stage is all about picking the right founder, but it's hard to get a read on who they are
                  besides a. where they went to school, technical abilities, and past work experience. Also, because the companies are sector agnostic, I don't feel like I can give a fair reading to everyone.
              </li>
          </ul>
