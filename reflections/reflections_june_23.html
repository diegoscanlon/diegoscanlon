      <h2>reflections in june 2023</h2>
      <p>keeping track of what I do, who I meet, and how I feel in venture capital</p>

      <h4><em>June 4, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>assessing a company: what matters more in early stage assessment, founder or idea? or both equally as much?<br>
        also, what makes a good angel investor? and is it right for me?
          <ul>
              <li> 
                did some more format written assessments today of two companies that I like, Rupt and Layer. I really like both ideas but don't know too much about the founders. I don't know how much
                Thus, I don't feel like I can make a super fair assessment of the company's health without talking to the founder and seeing how motivated they are about the idea. Further confirms my thoughts that 
                in order to begin making good decisions. What I did enjoy though was when I got to write down my ideas for the product, ways that they should approach their GTM, companies that they should talk to and 
                strategies that they should work on. That being said, it did have me think a bit more about the stage of investing I want to do, which I'll continue here...
                </li>
              <li>
                ...I really like contributing to ideas and product, and think that early stage would allow me to do that best. However, I think maybe the concept of angel lends it self too much to arbitrary assessment metrics,
                (maybe ones I haven't learned yet, sure), but at the moment, it seems a bit vague what makes a good angel investor. However, for something maybe like Seed, more like Series A, where product, GTM is the main focus,
                I think that's where I can provide a much better value add. Just want to keep track of this thought.
                </li>
          </ul>
        angel assessment of companies is a little vague for me right now, but I love contributing to ideas and product and strategy, so a stage like Series A may allow me to provide more value add to a founder and their company.

      <h4><em>June 3, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>started sourcing work using PitchBook, running in to two issues: differentiated dealflow, sector agnostic <br>
          <ul>
              <li> The first is how to source differentiated dealflow. I can't imagine all 
                  new companies are on PitchBook, or that all the good companies are on there, so I need to figure out a way to find better companies/different more diversified sources. Came across 
                  <a href="https://www.scroobious.com/" target="blank">Scroobious</a > on Twitter (don't really like the name but not my company), and signed up. They allow founders to post quick videos 
                  about their companies, which I think is a great idea. Similar to what I find so valuable in the YC video application - quick, easy, and direct, but might also be a great sourcing
                  mechanism - looking at all the YC application videos, then reaching out to those people as well. The information is compiled there for you and is quickly and easily accessible. 
                  Maybe something that I can implement into this website - just a place where anyone with an idea can post a quick Loom or something similar, create tags, specifically for early stage.
                  </li>
              <li>The second is that becuase the focus of Techstars, who I'm doing the sourcing for is sector agnostic, I can't really say if a company is good or not, if a founding team is qualified or not.
                  So, what I think I'm going to do in the future is look at specific domains that I am interested in, make calls there, and let someone else look at healthcare or robotics.
                  </li>
          </ul>
        need to find a solution to get better dealflow - whether that be finding a source that not everyone has, or using a platform in a different way that gives me an edge to find better founders and companies.
      </p>

      <h4><em>June 2, 2023</em></h4>
      <p>started doing work for Techstars incubator, sector agnostic making it difficult
          <ul>
              <li>First tasks was going through a list of 150 sourced companies and ranking my favorites. Found it a little difficult to know what I should be looking for. I've heard early stage is all about picking the right founder, but it's hard to get a read on who they are
                  besides a. where they went to school, technical abilities, and past work experience. Also, because the companies are sector agnostic, I don't feel like I can give a fair reading to everyone.
              </li>
          </ul>
